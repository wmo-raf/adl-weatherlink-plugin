# Point the image's own user and group at the host's ids, so anything written
# into the bind-mounted plugin folder belongs to you rather than to root. Each
# remap is skipped when that id is already taken inside the image: on macOS
# `id -g` is 20, which is `dialout` here, and `id -u` is often 501, which is the
# image's own user. Skipping is safe because nothing downstream depends on the
# names -- the COPY above and the USER below are both numeric.
